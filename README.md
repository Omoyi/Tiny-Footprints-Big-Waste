üë∂ The Short Life of a Tiny Outfit: An Interactive Report
This project is a Single-Page Application (SPA) designed to draw attention to the environmental impact of baby clothes. It visualizes the accelerated consumption cycle and its global implications, featuring a detailed local case study on Rwanda and actionable solutions.

The report is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all desktop and mobile devices.

üöÄ Key Features
Interactive Navigation: A sticky navigation bar with a responsive mobile hamburger menu allows quick jumping between sections.

Narrative Flow: The content guides the user through a funnel, starting with Global Textile Waste and moving through the Accelerated Garment Lifecycle to the Rwanda Context and final Solutions.

Data Visualization: Includes two interactive charts (Bar Chart and Donut Chart) built with Chart.js to clearly visualize key textile metrics.

üìä Data & Visualizations
The report utilizes data from authoritative sources (e.g., Ellen MacArthur Foundation, UNEP, local Rwandan reports) to provide essential context.
